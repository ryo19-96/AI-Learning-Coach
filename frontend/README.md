# Frontend Directory

This directory is intended for the Next.js application.
Initialization was skipped because `Node.js` (and `npx`) was not found in the environment.

## How to initialize manually

1. Install Node.js.
2. Run the following command in this directory:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --eslint --no-tailwind --src-dir --app --import-alias "@/*"
   ```
